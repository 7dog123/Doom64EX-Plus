DOOM64EX+ supports its own version of DeHackED.

Because of the number of differences between DOOM64 and Classic Doom, every frame, thing, weapon, sprite and code pointer is different (except ammo).
I am documenting this as I go (others are welcome to help!).

In this directory you will find an example DEH file to use as reference to create your own.
