Doom64EX+
Myself and contributors have worked hard to make this the best EX+ release yet, by far.

This is also the first instance of a DOOM64 source port being truly portable to many architectures and Operating Systems, I have a huge amount of respect for the *BSD userbase and so I'm very happy I could make this a reality for them.


Changes in 3.6.5

FEATURE: Adding ability to compile with a macro that allows UNIX users to have config/save files written to a typical system directory instead of to the same directory as the executable (usually ~/.local/)
FEATURE: Mouse support on menu is back and working perfectly
ENHANCEMENT: Rename UnMaykr to Unmaker
ENHANCEMENT: Addition of DehackEd64 Patches and Documentation
ENHANCEMENT: Code and README cleanups
ENHANCEMENT: Replacing some free() calls to SDL_Free()
ENHANCEMENT: Man updates for Unix
ENHANCEMENT: Making the HUD more contrasty for easier viewing, but still keeping it nearly OG
ENHANCEMENT: Forcing an OpenGL 2.1 rendering context
ENHANCEMENT: Some code brought over from Chocolate Doom for WAD loading
ENHANCEMENT: ALSA is now default on Linux and OSS on BSD
BUGFIX: Fixes for menu sliders getting stuck and skipping
BUGFIX: Fixing the pistol not having the correct refire frame
BUGFIX: Fixes for case-sensitive filesystems
BUGFIX: Drag and drop on Windows now works
BUGFIX: Micro stutters and framedrops with lots of enemies
BUGFIX: Linux builds crashing
BUGFIX: RPI3 builds have better performance
BUGFIX: Do not hide anisotropic filtering menu option on devices that don't support it
BUGFIX: Shootable switches and secrets function
BUGFIX: 32bit and 64bit builds fully functional
BUGFIX: Improving the performance of fluidsynth
BUGFIX: Tracks with many simultaneous notes no longer desync
BUGFIX: Most midi tracks no longer have a long pause when unpausing the game
Again, thanks to all the contributors who made this release possible!

UNIX USERS
The binaries for *BSD and Linux systems come WITHOUT libraries. To use the binaries, please install the required dependencies (see README.md) from your package manager.

The software also supports AARCH64/ARM64 as well as macOS systems. I have not provided binaries yet as macOS builds are not ready for general use (I need to fix the RPATH of all my libraries), I (for now) would expect that ARM64 users on BSD and Linux would probably compile it themselves.

Enjoy this release of Doom64EX+

Changes in 3.6.4

* Initital DeHackED support (from Chocolate Doom)
* Linux save directory is now a base path, instead of a pref path
* Changes to IDKFA cheat to NOT give a backpack
* Accessibility option menu for those people who are sensitive to flashing lights
* VSync on Linux is now done via SDL_GL
* Fixed width type change for short and char (int16 and int8)

Enjoy!

Please note:

DeHackED support is in its infancy here.  All MISC options will work, such as giving yourself 1000 health or
setting a maxammo limit, per ammo limit etc..  all 'bugs' from Doom Classic are also represented.

However none of the 'thing' types, 'weapon' types or 'monster' types will work.  This is because in INFO.C and INFO.H
the pointers and positions are in a different order, for example, the Seargeant (POSS2 in D64) is in position 6, not 3.

This will be rectified in the next version where I am planning to have near 100% parity with Choco.  However, sounds, cheats,
BEX and string support is NOT being done.  This is because we have MAPINFO by default in DOOM64 and things can be customised there.

Changes in 3.6.3

* Micro stutter fixes
* Additional resolutions in EX+ and Launcher (to match the main program)
* Glext-based Vsync support with menu toggles
* Ability to set some video settings without having to restart
* IDCLEV cheat is removed, use the features menu to warp
* Buffer is raised to 32 from 24

Changes in 3.6.2

* OpenGL rendering fixes
* Renderer bleeding fixes
* VSync support by default
* Doublebuffering for inputs on some mice by default
* Depth and Buffers are set to 24 to prevent some stuttering and graphical bugs
* Vanilla demo playback of demos from titlescreen, they desync, but it is a start
* Animated pallette textures fixed (credit to Erick!) - Updated 30.10.2022

Changes in 3.6.1:

* Visual Studio project files
* Code cleanups for MSVC compilers
* Removed the WIN32 startup box that never really worked well.

Changes in 3.6.0:

* Lost Levels support

Note: Lost Levels are available after beating Hectic, or by using IDCLEV 34 or higher.

Changes in 3.5.0:

* Nightdive IWAD compatibility

Note: Please do NOT replace the default doom64ex-plus.wad file if compiling yourself.  This is now required 'as is' as it holds
the midi files that are still required, since the remaster uses FMOD, this is the only way to support the audio as it currently is.

Changes in 3.4.0:

* Fixes for the laser tracers of the UnMaker
* Fixing the UnMaker pickup text 'What the is this" display - Fix attributed to the_kovic
* Fixing the MED KIT YOU REALLY NEED bug
